## What is TCP/IP and OSI?

### Birth of the internet
1960 - what if we could connect are two computers together, 1969 the birth of the first network we called this arpa/net the usdod(Department of Defense) 

### Why we need a network model?
IBM created there own network and it was proprietary (Only worked with there stuff) like other companies meaning that they really didn't play well with others so they could design and create there own network model but there was no way for them to connect to each other. 

### TCP/IP model (Transmission control protocal)
The different layers that make up the TCP/IP model we have the physical layer (Ethernet cables),the data link layer, the network layer (IP addresses / routers) , the transport layer, and the application layer (Protocall).


### OSI model (Open System interconnection)
The OSI is similar to the tcp/ip in fact the OSI models shares the same layers with some extra layers: the physical layer (Ethernet cables),the data link layer, the network layer (IP addresses / routers) , the transport layer, the session layer, the presentation layer and the application layer (Protocall).

These two layers dont disappear when we talk about the tcp/ip model we just have them in the application layer.
Trick to remember the OSI model

|-------------|------------------|
|  ALL        | Application      |
|  PEOPLE     | Presentation     |
|  SEEM       | Session          |
|  TO         | Transport        |
|  NEED       | Network          |
|  DATA       | Data link        |
|  PROCESSIONG| Physical         | 


### Why we still talk about OSI
