# Layer8_Networking

I wanted to create something for new members that are interested in CSUN Layer 8 club here you can practice the your skills in documentation
trouble shooting network devices, and learn how to present your work to other club members to better reinforced what you learned

### CCNA
The CCNA file is just notes taken from "Network Chuck" where you will have a better understanding of how network devices work.

### ISO-Setup
The ISO-Setup file will have different iso file on how to setup different iso file that will try and focus on networking mainly PFsense, but 
will have documentation on linux distros that are quick and simple to setup. This will help you manage your time better if you have to 
complete injects, or help at the CCDC competition.
> Its important to note if you have a chance to cross train in a different field (Windows or Linux) take it to be more useful in your career.

### Lab-Practice
This Lab-Practice file is where you will learn how to improve you documentation, learn how to write response to injects , and really learn 
with hands on training in the club. 

### Subnet-Cheat-Sheet
This Subnet-Cheat-Sheet is a file that has all the subnets and how many users will be in each subnet you setup.
